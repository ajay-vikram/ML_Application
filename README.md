A simple web application that employs Machine Learning models to predict a student's score based on other factors. Note that the values for the various features are dummy and not scraped from realistic sources. The main aim of this project is to illustrate the end-to-end creation of a web application that uses machine learning models to serve back data to the user. This can be thought of as a generic template that can be used for any other application that uses ML. The application has been deployed on render.
