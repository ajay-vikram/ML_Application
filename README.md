# Aim
The main aim of this project is to illustrate the end-to-end creation of a simple web application that uses **machine learning models** to serve back data to the user. This can be thought of as a **generic template** that can be used for any other ML application. 

# Description
A simple web application that employs Machine Learning models to predict a student's score based on other factors. Note that the values for the various features are **dummy** and not representative of real-world data. The User Interface has been kept to a bare minimum and can be changed as per requirement. The application has been deployed on a free web service called **render**.
